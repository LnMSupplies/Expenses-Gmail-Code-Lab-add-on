# Expenses-Gmail-Code-Lab-add-on
This is mostly copied from the Google Repo for Gmail Addons , https://github.com/googlecodelabs/gmail-add-ons.git    I've added some of my own code which will show a calculated Ontario Tax amount (13%) or if the regex see's USD 1 space before or after the final price it will look up the CAD to USD exchange rate from the date the email was received and apply it to the amount and show it in the Tax field. I was hoping to add an auto save option as well for any pdf attachments but I have to actually do my taxes at some point and stop making tools to help me do the work itself.
